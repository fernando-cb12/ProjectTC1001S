# Image Processing with Convolution Filters

## Overview
The first step in innovation is understanding the current standards. This project explores different convolution filters used in image processing, comparing their effects and selecting the most suitable one for our implementation.

## Common Convolution Filters

1. **Edge Detection Filters (Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian)**
   - Highlights edges by detecting sharp intensity changes.
   - Used in computer vision and image analysis.

2. **Blurring Filters (Gaussian Blur, Box Blur)**
   - Smooths the image by reducing noise and fine details.
   - Useful as preprocessing before feature detection.

3. **Sharpening Filters**
   - Enhances edges and fine details, making images appear sharper.
   - Commonly used for image enhancement.

4. **Feature Enhancement Filters (Emboss, High-pass Filters)**
   - Highlights textures and patterns in the image.
   - Useful for emphasizing specific visual features.

5. **Low-pass and High-pass Filters**
   - Remove specific frequency components, reducing noise or enhancing details.
   - Used in signal processing and image analysis.

## Research Sources
We explored the following sources to understand and compare these filters:
- **Academic Papers & Documentation**
  - "CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" (Stanford)
  - OpenCV documentation on filters and convolutions
  - "Deep Learning" - Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
- **Online References**
  - Medium, Towards Data Science articles on CNN and image processing

## Chosen Filter & Justification
After comparing various filters, we selected **Sobel Edge Detection Filter** because:
- **Enhances edges effectively** by computing intensity gradients in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- **Preserves important image details** while removing unnecessary noise.
- **Widely used in computer vision applications**, such as object recognition and segmentation.

This filter aligns best with our project requirements and enhances image processing performance.

## How to Implement
To apply this filter in our project, follow these steps:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
gray_image = cv2.imread('input.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply the Sobel filter in both directions
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(gray_image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(gray_image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)

# Combine both directions
sobel_combined = cv2.magnitude(sobel_x, sobel_y)

# Normalize and convert to uint8
sobel_combined = np.uint8(255 * sobel_combined / np.max(sobel_combined))

# Save and display the result
cv2.imwrite('output.jpg', sobel_combined)
cv2.imshow('Sobel Edge Detection', sobel_combined)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Conclusion
By implementing the **Sobel Edge Detection Filter**, we can effectively extract edges from images, improving the ability of our project to analyze visual features. This technique is commonly used in artificial intelligence applications, making it a valuable addition to our image processing pipeline.
