# Image Processing with Convolution Filters

## Overview
The first step in innovation is understanding the current standards. This project explores different convolution filters used in image processing, comparing their effects and selecting the most suitable one for our implementation.

## Common Convolution Filters

1. **Edge Detection Filters (Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian)**
   - Highlights edges by detecting sharp intensity changes.
   - Used in computer vision and image analysis.

2. **Blurring Filters (Gaussian Blur, Box Blur)**
   - Smooths the image by reducing noise and fine details.
   - Useful as preprocessing before feature detection.

3. **Sharpening Filters**
   - Enhances edges and fine details, making images appear sharper.
   - Commonly used for image enhancement.

4. **Feature Enhancement Filters (Emboss, High-pass Filters)**
   - Highlights textures and patterns in the image.
   - Useful for emphasizing specific visual features.

5. **Contrast Enhancement Filters**
   - Improves the visibility of details by increasing the difference between light and dark regions.
   - Used in medical imaging, photography, and computer vision.

## Research Sources
We explored the following sources to understand and compare these filters:
- **Academic Papers & Documentation**
  - "CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" (Stanford)
  - OpenCV documentation on filters and convolutions
  - "Deep Learning" - Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
- **Online References**
  - Medium, Towards Data Science articles on CNN and image processing

## Chosen Filter & Justification
After comparing various filters, we selected **Contrast Enhancement Filter** because:
- **Increases image clarity** by improving the distinction between different intensity levels.
- **Enhances important details** in images, making them more suitable for analysis.
- **Commonly used in real-world applications**, such as medical imaging, photography, and surveillance.

This filter aligns best with our project requirements and enhances image processing performance.

## Conclusion
By implementing the **Contrast Enhancement Filter**, we improve the visibility of key details in images, making them more useful for analysis in various applications. This technique is widely used in medical imaging, photography, and computer vision, making it a valuable addition to our image processing pipeline.
